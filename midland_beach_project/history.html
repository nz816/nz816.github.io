			<p>Midland Beach was originally part of a small Dutch community in the mid-1600s. It remained a small residential community until the 1880s. At the end of the 19th century, the area saw massice changes as investors recognized its potential in attracting New Yorkers looking to escape the city's summer heat. Akin to the attractions of Coney Island, Midland Beach became lined with hotels, bathing pavilions, resorts, theaters, carousels, and Ferris wheels.</p>
			
			<p>
			One of the main attractions of Midland Beach was the Happyland Amusement Park. It opened in June of 1906 with rides, shows, and lights bringing in 30,000 visitors. The most impressive displays were the Japanese Tea Gardens and the Carnival of Venice. 
			</p>
						<p>
			The coast of Midland Beach thrived despite multiple fires. However, the Great Depression caused many resorts to shutter its doors as the crows disappeared.

			In 1935, the city gained control of the beachfront property. With state and federal funding, it was renovated as part of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration (WPA). These efforts created much needed jobs during the Depression and revived the neighborhood. This included the construction of the two and a half-mile boardwalk. 
			</p>
			<p>
			However, Midland Beach faced another challenge. In July 1988, much of the waterfront was closed due to water pollution and excess waste in the ocean. The fishing industry declined as fish and dolphins died unexpectedly. The pollution came from a combination of industrial and residential sewage, toxic run-ff, ocean dumping, and garbage from ships. Midland Beach's tourist industry ceased to exist.
			</p>
			<p>
			The neighborhood never managed to bounce back to the heights of its hay day but is now a quiet residential area. There are remnants of the resorts that used to line the waterfront. For example, many of the beachside bungalows have been converted to family homes.
