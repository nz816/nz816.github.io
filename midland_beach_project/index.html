			<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; font-family: system-ui;">Midland Beach is a neighborhood in Staten Island, New York that has a population of 21,456. It lies along the east coast of the island in an area locally known as "Mid-Island." Historically, this area was a popular destination as a resort hotspot starting in the 1890s. A series of fires destroyed much of the resort buildings and attractions. This neighborhood is now a quiet residential area. </p>

			<p>Staten Island - Superstorm Sandy Â© November 2012, John de Guzman</p>
			<h2>Hurricane Sandy</h2>
			<p>
				In 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused unprecedented damage to this area. Midland Beach was one of the hardest coastal areas of Staten Island. This was due to its close proximity to the ocean and an inefficient drainage systen. Additionally, the surrounding areas of this neighborhood are wetlands that flood easily and often. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Over 2,000 properties in Midland Beach were damaged -- many homes were torn down and never rebuilt. At least 20 of the 34 fatalities attributed to Hurricane Sandy in New York City occurred on Staten Island.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Years late, residents who decided to stay in this neighborhood say that the flooding has been more and more frequent. Many of the powerful storms that devastate Midland Beach can be attributed to climate change.

			<h2>Today - The Bluebelt Program</h2>
			<p>
				In an effort to prepare Midland Beach for future flooding, the NYC Department of Environmental Protection created the Bluebelt Program to preserve natural drainage corridors to enhance their abilit to convey, store, and filter runoff precipitation or stormwater. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The result is an ecologically rich and cost-effective drainage system. The Bluebelt Program is comprised of New Creek and Slater Creek. The $22 million project also beautifies this residential neighborhood and includes pedestrian bridges across the creeks and recreational areas.

			<p style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px; font-family: system-ui;">Before construction for the Bluebelt Program broke ground, this neighborhood was gray and sleepy in the midst of recovering from Hurricane Sandy. Even in 2022, there is a sense of fear from residents who chose to stay in Midland Beach about the next disaster that will strike. In 2022, there is a new feeling of hope and resilience. Efforts to protect this neighborhood, including a planned seawall, have been strong. The view as you walk along the creek is remarkable against the backdrop of a sunset. Although it is a quiet neighborhood, you can find the occasional person jogging along or cruising on their bike. </p>
